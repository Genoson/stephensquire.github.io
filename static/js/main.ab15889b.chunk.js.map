I'm Stephen Squire a student at Keyin College currently enrolled\n            in my second semester of the Software Development program. I have\n            always had an affinity for technology and computers. I spend a lot\n            of time reading about the newest breakthroughs in hardware and\n            software. My hobbies include cooking, gaming, and hanging out \n            with my partner, cats, and dog.\n          </p>\n          <figure><img src=\"\" alt=\"Dax\" /></figure>\n          <p className=\"leftAlign\">\n            My love affair with technology started young. I was always into\n            science fiction shows, books, and movies growing up. The\n            Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Donatello was my favourite), Star\n            Wars, Star Trek, the Alien franchise, and The Matrix, to name a few.\n            I always found myself fascinated by the fictional science and\n            technology of the worlds portrayed in these works, and often wondered\n            where the line between science fiction, science future, and science\n            fact lay.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"leftAlign\">\n            Fast forward to my early twenties. I was enrolled at Memorial\n            University taking courses in all of the sciences and maths, but not\n            having any direction besides a general lust for understanding. I\n            dropped out of school and kind of bounced around between jobs before\n            landing in a professional kitchen. The hook was set and I spent the\n            rest of my twenties and early thirties mastering the skills required to\n            excel in a restaurant's kitchen. Eventually I became the head chef of\n            a local restaurant, writing a menu, training staff, and overseeing the\n            minutia of keeping a restaurant profitable. At this point, this was no longer the\n            job I had fallen in love with.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"leftAlign\">\n            The Covid-19 pandemic struck right as I was becoming jaded with the\n            lifestyle of being a chef, shutting down restaurants the world over,\n            and giving me ample time to do some soul searching. On one such\n            evening sitting around at home, doom-scrolling my technology-centric\n            newsfeed, I stumbled upon the \"Flippy\" robot by Miso Robotics. This\n            little robotic arm was flipping burgers, cooking fries, and coming\n            for the entry-level jobs in the restaurant industry; like robots have\n            in so many others before. I found myself thinking about how I needed to get\n            on the right side of this revolution in automation. Not long after, I\n            heard of this program at Keyin, and the rest is history.\n          </p>\n          <figure><img src=\"\" alt=\"Flippy\" /></figure>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <h3>\n          My Motivations and Goals\n          <hr />\n        </h3>\n\n        <article class=\"two\">\n          <p>\n            As mentioned in the previous section, my journey into this field has\n            taken a lifetime to get started. On the bright side, I have a\n            lifetime of looking in on the field as a passionate hobbyist to\n            guide my decisions as I travel deeper down the rabbit hole of\n            software development.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Coming into this program at Keyin, I had no idea what to expect or\n            where it would take me. I honestly still don't, but I am beginning\n            to form an idea of where I'd like to end up, and what I'd like to be\n            doing when I get there. Across the rest of this section I hope to\n            lay bare my thought process in narrowing my sights.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            First off, I knew when I started I wanted to work in a creative\n            role. That was my favourite part of being a chef and there are a lot\n            of similarities between the creation processes of writing and refining\n            a new recipe for a professional kitchen, and that of writing a piece\n            of software. Knowing what you want to create is only the beginning\n            of the process in both cases; the real meat of the work lies in\n            identifying the ingredients and procedures needed to get there. Then \n            refining the product to be more efficient and that recipe to be easy\n             for colleagues to read and reproduce.\n            \n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Secondly, I know I want to work with code at the cutting edge\n            of whichever field I find myself in. Be that web design, as we are\n            studying this semester, or machine learning and deep learning\n            applications which are already surrounding us, revolutionizing how we\n            work, shop, eat, and play. This desire to be at the forefront of\n            innovation will ensure this career path is one of lifelong learning.\n            Which is the point of this journey; my desire to constantly learn, be\n            challenged, and grow my skill-set sits quite well with the\n            expectations of being a software developer.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Finally, I wish to build a strong foundation of skills like those offered\n            in this program at Keyin, in a curated and employment-focused\n            manner. The purely academic studies I had previously\n            attempted were far less in line with how I am able to motivate\n            myself to learn. \n          </p>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <aside class=\"left\"></aside>\n      <section>\n        <h3>\n          What's Hot in Tech Today - My Hot Take\n          <hr />\n        </h3>\n        <article  class=\"one\">\n          <p>\n            As an avid follower of the technology sector I have been keeping up\n            on all of the news in a variety of fields of personal interest, and I hope\n            to be able to shed some light on them to you here.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A major trend in technology today is the electrification of our\n            transportation network; be that Tesla with their electric and self\n            driving cars, or Ford with their new Lightning F-150. Also, many major\n            retailers such as Canadian Tire, have committed to converting\n            their transport truck fleet, eventually shifting the entire trucking\n            industry to a self-driving electric model. On the smaller scale,\n            Amazon has delivery drones in many cities. All these innovations will be\n            running some form of software, and will require skilled software\n            technicians to develop and maintain them.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Another major trend is in machine learning; leveraging new types of\n            software and hardware to offload tasks that previously only a human\n            could perform. Facial recognition, voice recognition, self-driving\n            cars, and the photo software on our cell phones all utilize some\n            level of this technology. It is also being used to study and derive\n            useful information from very large datasets. We are all familiar\n            with Facebook and Google advertisements being specifically curated\n            for each of us individually. This point in particular has created\n            a large, ongoing debate about the ethics of using machines for\n            these tasks. Does a piece of software that sorts resumes for an\n            accounting firm have any bias baked into its code? Should we\n            develop technologies that could be used to discriminate? How do we\n            write code that avoids these issues? There is so much more to this\n            topic I simply find fascinating.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Another point of interest I have is smaller in scope than the previous two. \n            Literally. Cell phones and tablets have dramatically shifted how digital\n            content is consumed. With this change in digital content, it has forced\n            a shift in how it is made as well. Today, a website for a business is\n            all but useless if it hasn't been designed with these smaller\n            devices in mind. As such, modern web development practices that\n            include a wide array of compatibility with all sorts of devices is\n            needed at all levels of web development. Coupled to this point is\n            the shift of consumer habits towards online marketplaces. This small\n            screen revolution needs a big workforce of software developers that\n            use the most up-to-date standards of web design.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            My final point in this section has importance across all my previously\n            mentioned topics. Security. As more and more of our activities\n            become driven by technology, a security vulnerability in software\n            can be very disruptive. Having an unsecured or outdated piece of\n            tech in the daisy chain of devices we now trust with all of\n            our personal data could lead to any number of problems. Identity\n            theft can happen to any one of us and we may never even know how it\n            happened. Industries have been taken hostage by malicious code\n            getting into factories or power plants, and businesses have been\n            destroyed over damages caused by the mishandling of sensitive data.\n            Learning how to write secure code is as essential as updating old code\n            to new security standards in a constantly-evolving field with lots\n            of opportunity.\n          </p>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      \n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n","import React from 'react'\n\nconst Contact = () => {\n    return (\n        <div id=\"contactMe\">\n            <h1>Thanks for choosing to contact me</h1>\n            <article >\n                <p>\n                    You can find my github profile <a href=\"https://github.com/Genoson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    You can find my LinkedIn profile <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-squire-6a3a8a211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    you can email me here <a href=\"mailto:stevesquire13@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Email Me</a> <br/>\n                    or directly at stephen.squire@keyin.com\n                </p>\n            </article>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Contact\n","import React, {useEffect} from 'react'\nimport Featured from \"../components/Featured\"\n\nconst Projects = () => {\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n        \n    }, [])\n    return (\n        <div id=\"projectsPage\">\n            <h1>Projects site currently under development</h1>\n            <p>Please see the below section for a sampling of whats to come.</p>\n            <p>Check out my weather app in action here: <a href=\"https://genoson.github.io/weatherapp.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Weather App</a></p>\n            <div id=\"featuredWorkContainer\">\n                <Featured />\n                \n                </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Projects\n","\nimport './App.css';\nimport {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport Header from './components/Header';\nimport Home from './pages/Home';\nimport Footer from './components/Footer';\nimport About from './pages/About';\nimport Contact from './pages/Contact';\nimport Projects from './pages/Projects';\n\nfunction App() {\n  \n  return (\n    <Router>\n      \n    <Header />\n    <main id=\"pageBody\">\n    <Home />\n      <Routes>\n      <Route path=\"\" element={null} />\n      <Route path=\"about\" element={<About />} />\n      <Route path=\"contact\" element={<Contact />} />\n      <Route path=\"projects\" element={<Projects />} />\n    </Routes>\n    </main>\n    <Footer />\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
